Quarto is an open source scientific writing package that helps you write articles, create presentations, and publish websites. It supports integration with Python and R, and can render .pdf, .docx, .html, .pptx files and multiple other types of documents.\nIf you want to make your own, the first step is to download and install Quarto. It can be run in RStudio or VSCode (along with other apps). To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\nTo host a personal website on github you need to create a github repository using a special format: User-Name.github.io\n\nThis isn’t necessary to host a regular webpage with github, only if you want to make a “homepage” for yourself. i.e., the repo for this site is: https://github.com/June-Skeeter/june-skeeter.github.io, so when the page is rendered it shows up as https://june-skeeter.github.io/\nYou can use other naming conventions if you don’t need this. i.e., the here is a repo hosted on the micromet github: https://github.com/ubc-micromet/FieldSiteMaps, and the corresponding github page address is https://ubc-micromet.github.io/FieldSiteMaps/"

    "text": "Hi! I’m Dr. June Skeeter. I am a micrometeorologist and spatial data scientist working at the University of British Columbia. I’m a fluent Python programmer with functional proficiency in a number of other languages including JavaScript and Matlab. I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my pedagogical philosophy and personal research practices. I’ve created this website to highlight some of my work and provide a template that others can use to make their own website!"

    "text": "Here is a sampling of some of the things I’ve been working on …\n\nField Work\nI work in Burn’s Bog; I maintain a couple of our group’s Eddy Covariance (EC) stations and assist with other ongoing projects in the bog. We’re starting a flux chamber data collection campaign and I’ll be installing a short-term EC station on a portable tripod this summer.\n\nThe bog is a tricky place to navigate so I created this web-app to help! It shows our sites and access trails plotted over high resolution satellite imagery. It can also be help with surveying in the field using GPS on a mobile device to track a user and record/download waypoints.\n\n\n<div style=\"overflow: hidden;\n  padding-top: 56.25%;\n  position: relative\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://ubc-micromet.github.io/FieldSiteMaps/\" title=\"Processes\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"\n    style=\"border: 0;\n   height: 100%;\n   left: 0;\n   position: absolute;\n   top: 0;\n   width: 100%;\">\n   <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\n </iframe>\n</div>\n<a href=\"https://ubc-micromet.github.io/FieldSiteMaps/\" target=\"_blank\">View Slides in New Tab</a>\n\n\n\nTeaching\nI have published all of my course material for GEOS 270 as an Open Educational Resource (OER) on Github. The syllabus can be found here: https://geos270.github.io/Syllabus/. The course webpage has links to all of my course content, posted in an openly accessible format. All content for the term is hyperlinked in the schedule on the course overview page. I feel this is the most effective, transparent, and accessible way I can provide content for my students. I find the institutional tools provided by UBC (e.g., Canvas) to be severely lacking in functionality and an obvious barrier to accessibility. By using Github I can tailor my course webpage as I see fit, prospective students can review this syllabus and other content to see if they might be interested in the course, and students will continue to have access the course content even after they graduate!\nI have years of experience teaching GOES 270, all of my available teaching evaluations are posted here. The wording of the evaluation questions has changed between terms, but one key question has not changed: Considering everything, how would you rate this course? The chart and table below summarize my student’s responses.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Student repsones to the question: Considering everything, how would you rate this course?\n\n\nYear\nTerm\nSection\nN\nn\nVery Poor\nPoor\nNeutral\nGood\nVery Good\nFavorable\nResponse Rate\n\n\n\n\n2020\nS1\n1\n70\n37\n0\n1\n2\n20\n14\n0.92\n0.53\n\n\n2020\nW2\n201\n76\n27\n0\n0\n2\n11\n14\n0.93\n0.36\n\n\n2020\nW2\n202\n69\n20\n0\n1\n3\n9\n7\n0.8\n0.29\n\n\n2021\nW1\n101\n97\n41\n2\n3\n2\n19\n15\n0.83\n0.42\n\n\n2021\nW2\n201\n45\n11\n0\n0\n1\n6\n4\n0.91\n0.24\n\n\n2022\nS1\n1\n33\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n1\n0.12\n\n\n2022\nW1\n101\n94\n33\n1\n1\n1\n9\n21\n0.91\n0.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Student repsones to the question: Considering everything, how would you rate this course?"
