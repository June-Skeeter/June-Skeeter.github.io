The tool also has the capability to include a vegetation map for the site to better estimate the flux contribution by different source/sink area\n\nI’m still working on preparing/documenting the code for broader distribution.

I am currently working at the University of British Columbia as a postdoctoral researcher and sessional instructor. My principal area of focus is the processes governing ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane; and the resulting feedbacks that influence the global climate system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m an avid programmer I am fluent in Python and functionally proficient in a number of other languages including JavaScript, R, and Matlab. I love making maps and enjoy creating interactive, web-based applications for research and education. I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my research and pedagogical philosophies.\n\nI created this website to highlight some of my work and provide a template others can use to make their own website!\n\nIf you’d like to use this template, clone the repo and try it out for yourself!"
