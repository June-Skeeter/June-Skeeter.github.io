Quarto is an open source scientific writing package that helps you write articles, create presentations, and publish websites. It supports integration with Python and R, and can render .pdf, .docx, .html, .pptx files and multiple other types of documents.\nIf you want to make your own, the first step is to download and install Quarto. It can be run in RStudio or VSCode (along with other apps). To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\nTo host a personal website you need to create a github repository using this format: User-Name.github.io\n\nThis isn’t necessary to host a regular webpage with github, only if you want to make a “homepage” for yourself. i.e., the repo for this site is: https://github.com/June-Skeeter/june-skeeter.github.io, so when the page is rendered it shows up as https://june-skeeter.github.io/\nYou can use other naming conventions if you don’t need this. i.e., the here is a repo hosted on the micromet github: https://github.com/ubc-micromet/FieldSiteMaps, and the corresponding github page address is https://ubc-micromet.github.io/FieldSiteMaps/"

    "text": "Hi! I’m Dr. June Skeeter. I am a micrometeorologist and spatial data scientist working at the University of British Columbia. I’m a fluent Python programmer with functional proficiency in a number of other languages including JavaScript and Matlab. I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my pedagogical philosophy and personal research practices. I’ve created this website to highlight some of my work and provide a template that others can use to make their own website! If you’d like to use this template, you can clone the repo and try it out for yourself!\n\nAdded a bullet point here!"
