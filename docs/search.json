    "text": "GEOS 270 Course Syllabus\nI have published all of my course material for GEOS 270 as an Open Educational Resource (OER) on Github. The syllabus can be found here: https://geos270.github.io/Syllabus/. The course webpage has links to all of my course content, posted in an openly accessible format. All content for the term is hyperlinked in the schedule on the course overview page. I feel this is the most effective, transparent, and accessible way I can provide content for my students. I find the institutional tools provided by UBC (e.g., Canvas) to be severely lacking in functionality and an obvious barrier to accessibility. By using Github I can tailor my course webpage as I see fit, prospective students can review this syllabus and other content to see if they might be interested in the course, and students will continue to have access the course content even after they graduate!\n\n\nEvidence of Teaching Effectiveness\nI have numerous semesters of experience teaching GOES 270, all of my previous teaching evaluations are available here. The wording of the evaluation questions has changed between terms, but one key question has not changed: Considering everything, how would you rate this course? The chart and table below summarize my student’s responses."

    "text": "When discussing discrimination against transgender community, the poet Alok Vaid Menon said: “It’s never been about comprehension, it’s been about compassion”. Acts of discrimination and violence may be committed by individuals, but they are systemic issues rooted in a culture that does not prioritize empathy. As a non-binary person, I have some personal insight into how exclusive our society can be and it heartens me to know I am in a position to provide some of the representation to my students and colleagues that I my younger self missed out on.\nAt the same time, my white privilege precludes me from fully understanding the challenges my BIPOC colleagues and students face. While I many not comprehend, I can leverage my privilege and platform as an researcher and educator to help elevate others and work towards building a more compassionate world. I try to center this intention in my work. Marginalized people need to be empowered, uplifted, and given the support they need to succeed. Further, those who are not marginalized need to be made aware of the systemic injustices that permeate the fabric of our society and be encouraged contemplate their positionality to help breakdown their prejudices build their capacity for empathy.\nSome ways I have been approaching this task in my work include:\n\nCentering discussions of ethical practices in the sciences and emphasizing that the choices we make as practitioners, intended or otherwise, can have drastic impacts on peoples lives.\nTeaching about the history of the cartography and how it has been used as a tool of oppression in my GIS course.\nIncorporating Indigenous narratives and examples traditional knowledge into my course material.\nOffering flexible grading policies, including reduced late penalties and a “one-free-miss” policy for lab assignments.\nPublishing my course materials Open Educational Resources (OER) to reduce financial barriers for students and facilitate collaboration between instructors.\nStreaming all of my in-person lectures and posting recording with subtitles.\nAdvocating for gender inclusivity and gender neutral washroom access in my workplace.\nOpenly discussing my past struggles with mental health and encouraging my colleagues and students to prioritize their own mental health.\nMy volunteer work researching police violence in Canada.\n\nIn my career, I have worked with a diverse group of people from around the world and I have learned many lessons from them. I have done my best so far to support an inclusive environment in my workplace and classroom and make my instructional materials accessible to a diverse audience. But there is always more work to do and I am committed to must pursuing opportunities to listen, learn, and humble myself. It is my hope that by fostering a culture of empathy, honesty, and critical reflection in my workplaces and classrooms, I can contribute in some small way to making the world a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive place."

I specialize in micrometeorology, geospatial data science, and machine learning methods. I’m a fluent Python programmer with functional proficiency in a number of other languages including JavaScript and Matlab. I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my pedagogical philosophy and personal research practices.
