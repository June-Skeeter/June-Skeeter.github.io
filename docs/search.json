I use the XeTeX engine which I you can find here; you can also try installing “TinyTex” instead directly through Quarto by typing this command in the termina:\n’‘’console quarto install tinytex’’’\nThis template also uses the quarto package Section Bibliographies Filter - I’ve included it in this repo (under _extensions) because I’ve altered it slightly from its orignal format. It should work as is? But you may need to install it with first then replace with the updated version.\nDon’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions."

Quarto is an open source scientific writing package that helps you write articles, create presentations, and publish websites. It supports integration with Python and R, and can render .pdf, .docx, .html, .pptx files and multiple other types of documents.\nIf you want to make your own, the first step is to download and install Quarto. It can be run in RStudio or VSCode (along with other apps). To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\nTo host a personal website you need to create a github repository using this format: User-Name.github.io\n\nThis isn’t necessary to host a regular webpage with github, only if you want to make a “homepage” for yourself. i.e., the repo for this site is: https://github.com/June-Skeeter/june-skeeter.github.io, so when the page is rendered it shows up as https://june-skeeter.github.io/\nYou can use other naming conventions if you don’t need this. i.e., the here is a repo hosted on the micromet github: https://github.com/ubc-micromet/FieldSiteMaps, and the corresponding github page address is https://ubc-micromet.github.io/FieldSiteMaps/"

My principal area of focus is the processes governing ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane; and the resulting feedbacks that influence the global climate system.\nI’m an adept programmer fluent Python programmer with functional proficiency in a number of other languages including JavaScript and R. I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my research and pedagogical philosophies.\n\nI created this website to highlight some of my work and provide a template others can use to make their own website!\n\nIf you’d like to use this template, clone the repo and try it out for yourself!"
