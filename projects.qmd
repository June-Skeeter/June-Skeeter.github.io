Here is a sampling of some of the things I've been working on.  

# Field Work

Through my career I've done field work all over the world, from pine plantations in New Zealand to tundra sites in the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories.

Presently, I mostly work in Burn's Bog in Delta, BC.

* I maintain a couple of our group's Eddy Covariance (EC) stations and assist with other ongoing projects in the bog.  
* We're starting a flux chamber data collection campaign and I'll be installing a short-term EC station on a portable tripod this summer.

# Mapping

The bog is a tricky place to navigate so I created this web-app to help!  It shows our sites and access trails plotted over high resolution satellite imagery.  It can also be help with surveying in the field using GPS on a mobile device to track a user and record/download waypoints.

# Teaching

I have published all of my course material for GEOS 270 as an Open Educational Resource (OER) on Github.  The syllabus can be found [here](https://geos270.github.io/Syllabus/), it has links to all of the course content in the schedule on the course overview page.  

* I feel this is the most effective, transparent, and accessible way I can provide content for my students.
  * The institutional tools provided by UBC (e.g., Canvas) to be lacking in functionality and flexibility;  they also pose an obvious barrier to accessibility.  
* By using Github I can tailor my course webpage as I see fit, prospective students can review this syllabus and other content to see if they might be interested in the course, and students will continue to have access the course content even after they graduate!

## Evaluations

I have years of experience teaching GOES 270, all of my available teaching evaluations are posted [here](https://github.com/June-Skeeter/june-skeeter.github.io/tree/main/Evaluations).  The wording of the evaluation questions has changed between terms, but one key question has not changed: **Considering everything, how would you rate this course?**  The chart and table below summarize my student's responses.

```{python}
#| label: fig-evals
#| echo: false
#| cap-location: margin
#| fig-cap: "Student repsones to the question: Considering everything, how would you rate this course?"

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Evals = pd.read_csv("Evaluations/Considering_everything_how_would_you_rate_this_course.csv")

Summary = Evals[['Very Poor','Poor','Neutral','Good','Very Good']].sum()
Evals['Response Rate'] = (Evals['n']/Evals['N']).round(2)
# Evals['Favorability'] = Evals[['Good','Very Good']].sum(axis=1)/Summary.sum()
Terms = Evals['N'].count()

fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,4))
ax.bar(Summary.index,Summary,facecolor='#3248a8',edgecolor='k')
ax.grid(axis='y')
ax.set_ylabel('Total Responses')
ax.set_title('Summary of my Teaching Evaluations')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```


```{python}
#| label: tbl-planets
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Student repsones to the question: Considering everything, how would you rate this course?"
