Hi! I'm Dr. June Skeeter.  I am a micrometeorologist and spatial data scientist.  I am currently working at the University of British Columbia as a postdoctoral researcher and sessional instructor.  My principal area of focus is the processes governing ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane; and the resulting feedbacks that influence the global climate system.

I'm an avid programmer.  I am fluent in Python and functionally proficient in a number of other languages including JavaScript, R, and Matlab.  I love making maps and enjoy creating interactive, web-based applications for research and education.  I prefer to work with open source options whenever possible because accessibility of information, transparency in data analysis, and minimizing barriers to access are central to my research and pedagogical philosophies.  

* I created this website to highlight some of my work and provide a template others can use to make their own website!
